Description: The recount2 project re-processed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data on
    over 70,000 human RNA-seq samples spanning a variety of tissues, cell types
    and disease conditions. Researchers can easily access these data via the
    recount Bioconductor package, and can quickly import gene, exon, exon-exon
    junction and base-pair coverage data for uniformly processed data from the
    SRA, GTEx and TCGA projects in R for analysis. This workshop will cover
    different use cases of the recount package, including downloading and
    normalizing data, processing and cleaning relevant phenotype data,
    performing differential expression (DE) analyses, and creating reports for
    exploring the results using other Bioconductor packages. The workshop will
    also cover how to use the base-pair coverage data for annotation-agnostic DE
    analyses and for visualizing coverage data for features of interest. After
    taking this workshop, attendees will be ready to enhance their analyses by
    leveraging RNA-seq data from 70,000 human samples.
